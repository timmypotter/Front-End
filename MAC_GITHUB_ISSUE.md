Old account of the GitHub cannot be cleared by resetting the git config only
Need to do as bellow:

    start keychain access (start spotlight via cmd + space, type keychain, press enter)

    Under keychains on the upper left, select "login" Under category on the left, select "passwords"

    find the name "github" and delete it.

Then I can normally access GitHub by new account
